**Oyster Message** combines a powerful translation library with the advantages of **MiniMessage**, **PlaceholderAPI** and

You can easily include translations for different languages in your plugin. Partly translated files will be
automatically updated once you provide a newer version of the translations. User-made changes are always kept, of
course.
