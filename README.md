**Messagess** combines a powerful translation library with the advantages of the **MiniMessage** API.

You can easily include translations for different languages in your plugin. Partly translated files will be automatically updated
once you provide a newer version of the translations.

Also supports PlaceholderAPI and ItemsAdder emojis.
